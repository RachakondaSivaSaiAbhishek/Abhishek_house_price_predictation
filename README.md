This repository contains a Linear Regression model implemented by Abhishek for predicting house prices based on benchmark dataset features. The goal of this project is to leverage the power of machine learning to accurately estimate house prices using various relevant features.

## Dataset 📊

The dataset used for training and evaluation is a benchmark dataset that consists of information about different houses, including features such as area, number of rooms, location, and more. This dataset provides a solid foundation for training the model and making predictions.

## Model Architecture 🏗️

The house price prediction model is built using Linear Regression, a popular and widely used algorithm for predicting numerical values. The model takes into account multiple features from the dataset and applies linear regression techniques to estimate house prices.

## Usage 🚀

To use this model, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that the required dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt` are installed.
3. Load the benchmark dataset and preprocess it as necessary.
4. Run the `house_price_prediction.py` script to train the model on the dataset.
5. Use the trained model to predict house prices based on new inputs.

## Evaluation 📈

To evaluate the performance of the model, various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) are computed. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made by the model.

## Contributions 🤝
